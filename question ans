            continus service delivery even xxx 
            deal with software bugs during run-time
            design, program & run robust cloud services
            continuation of service in the face of failures
            reduce/minimize the negative influence of bugs
            availability, reliability, security and correctness of systems
            Avoid System Failures in the Presence of Faults
                it is about sys. interface
            develop effective fault tolerance mechanisms
            Here is about the step after the dev:
                Tolerate likely software faults that remain in the system after development

            passing a negative int number as array index 
            return a negative int number which will be used as para. of an assert statement 
                -- mistake 
            can not be reached 
                -- mistake-logical failure

            100% statement coverage does not imply 100% branch coverage
            branch coverage is a stronger condition 
            branch coverage apart from executing all the statements, 
                we should also verify if the tests executes all branches
